### Prerequisites

Before using the Binance Trade Bot, you need to configure your environment with the Binance API client credentials. These credentials allow the bot to interact securely with your Binance account. Follow these steps to set up:

1. **Obtain your Binance API Key and Secret**
   - Log in to your [Binance account](https://www.binance.com/).
   - Navigate to the API Management section.
   - Create a new API key, providing a label for it (e.g., `CLI_Bot`).
   - Save the **API Key** and **Secret Key** securely. You will not be able to view the secret again after closing the page.

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   Export the API credentials as environment variables in your terminal before executing the binance-bot cli:

   ```bash
   export BINANCE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   export BINANCE_API_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   ```

Now you're ready to use the Binance Trade Bot! üéâ

```bash
binance-bot bull-trade -t "XRP/USDT" -a 50 -sl 1.5 -tp 3.0 -b 0.9995 -s 1.0005 -rp 4 -ra 0
```

#### Example Command Details

## Trading Strategy Logic

### Bull-Trade

The `bull-trade` command is specifically designed to operate during **bull market trends**, leveraging upward momentum to execute profitable trades. It is optimized for market conditions where prices are generally increasing, making it less effective during bearish or sideways markets.


#### **Buy Conditions**
The bot will place a buy order when these conditions are met
1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - The RSI value must be **less than 70**, indicating that the market is not overbought.

2. **MACD Crossover**:
   - A buy signal is generated when the **MACD line crosses above the Signal line**, suggesting upward momentum.

3. **DEMA & EMA Confirmation**:
   - The market is considered to have an upward trend when the **15-period Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)** is **above** the **15-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**.

#### **Sell Conditions**
The bot will place a sell order when these conditions are met
1. **Take Profit Factor**:
    - The price reaches the **take-profit percentage** specified in the command.
    - The **MACD line crosses below the Signal line**, indicating potential downward momentum.
2. **Stop Loss Factor**:
   - The price drops to the **stop-loss percentage** specified in the command.

---

This strategy combines momentum indicators, trend confirmation, and predefined risk/reward factors to maximize trading opportunities during bull market conditions. However, the strategy is not designed to handle bearish or flat market trends and may result in losses under such conditions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Always test the bot in a safe environment (e.g., testnet or small amounts) before live trading. Ensure you understand the risks and implications of using automated trading strategies.
